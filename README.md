# Build info
---
HTML Builder uses Webpack (https://webpack.github.io) for building and bundling the front-end code. Webpack is configured through the config file "webpack.config.js". To build the front-end, you will want to make sure all dependencies (listed in package.json) are installed first. You can do this by running the command "npm install" (this is assuming you have NPM installed already). This will create a folder named "node_modules" which contains all the dependencies. You're now ready to rebuild the front-end, you can do this by running the command "npm run build".

To be able to run the build, you'll need to have Nodejs installed. Other dependencies can be found in /package.json.
